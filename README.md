# WebApp Deployment with Jenkins

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a web application using Jenkins.
The primary objective was to automate the build and deployment process, ensuring that code changes are quickly and efficiently integrated into production.

## Technologies Used
- **Jenkins**: A popular automation server used for building, deploying, and automating projects.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes in the project code.

## Prerequisites
- Jenkins installed and running, either locally or on a server.
- GitHub repository containing the web application code.

## Build Process
1. **Job Configuration**:
   - Set up a freestyle project in Jenkins to clone the GitHub repository containing the web application.
   - Configure the build steps to run any necessary scripts or commands to build the application.

2. **Artifact Management**:
   - Archive any artifacts generated during the build process for future use.

## Results
- The Jenkins job successfully cloned the repository and executed the build process.
- Build logs and artifacts were saved, demonstrating the successful execution of the project.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the implementation of CI/CD practices using Jenkins to streamline the development workflow. 
It provides an efficient way to manage application deployments and ensures that any changes made to the code are integrated smoothly into the production environment.
